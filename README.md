# Rhythmix-Music-Generation-Using-LSTM
Generation of music using existing MIDI files fed as input to the LSTM network, build using Python and TensorFlow.

RhythmiX is an AI-powered music generation system that composes unique piano melodies using deep learning. Built with LSTM networks, it processes MIDI data to create original musical patterns.

Features:
- Generates piano melodies from trained models.
- Uses LSTM neural networks for sequence learning.
- Trained on MIDI files for realistic compositions.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- MIDI Processing

How to Use:
- Clone this repo:
git clone https://github.com/devma5/Rhythmix-Music-Generation-Using-LSTM.git
- Open RhythmiX.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
- Run the notebook and generate MIDI music!
